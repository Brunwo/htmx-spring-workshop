# Lab 1: Server-side rendering with Spring Boot and JTE

The goal of this lab is to build a simple UserManagement Application with stock Spring Boot + JTE and htmx.

# Lab 2: Introducing Spring ViewComponent

The goal of this lab is to refactor the application to use Spring ViewComponent and htmx-spring-boot to delegate rendering responsibility to the ViewComponents and make the Controller thinner

# Lab 3: Using Spring Beans to compose the UI

In this short lab we will use the dependency injection capabilities to show a navigation bar where we can add new items by just creating new ViewComponents

# Lab 4: HandlerAdapters to handle Task Forms
